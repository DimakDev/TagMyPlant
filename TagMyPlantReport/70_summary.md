# Summary

In this project was implemented a scanning system, which can capture different types of barcodes, parse the barcode information and represent the information to the user.

The application contains the basic functionality needed for the scanning and data manipulation processes. There is still a room for further adoptions, tests and experiments.

* Unit and UI tests can be extended to increase the reliability of the application.
* Regex pattern can be also extended to parse another types of barcode information.

Other ideas and improvements have their place. The focus was on the basic functionality, needed to scan and represent the barcode information. To provide a richer experience for the users, the application can be improved to meet their individual requirements.

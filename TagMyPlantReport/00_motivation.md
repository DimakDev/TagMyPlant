# Motivation

Today we can see barcodes on nearly every product. They represent a piece of information. This information is machine-readable. It is mostly used to identify a product. 

The barcodes can be scanned with traditional laser scanners, or using camera-based imaging scanners. Professional scanning systems are used in industries with a large amount of product tracking information. They serve this information to IT-Systems, which can proceed the data and automate the production processes.

In this project was implemented a system to scan and represent the barcode information using only a smartphone. The motivation was to simulate a production process. The system should be able to scan barcodes continuously and make the barcode information accessible for the user.

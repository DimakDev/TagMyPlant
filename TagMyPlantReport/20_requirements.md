# Requirements

To define the value and purpose of the product, a list of features and requirements was specified. This helped ultimately in the process of prototyping and development to transform a concept into a functional product.

The following list of features and requirements becomes a foundation for further development.

## Architecture

-   **Single Page Application:** the navigation should be fast enough to guarantee a seamless and pleasant user experience.
-   **Data persistent:** to prevent a data lost between sessions, the data should be stored in a database.

## Functionality

-   **Continuously scanning:** multiple barcodes can be scanned in one session to simulate production environment requirements.
-   **Support for multiple barcode types:** it can be specified internally in the code or externally by the user.
-   **Torchlight:** the user can turn the torchlight on and off to scan a barcode in the dark.
-   **Barcode information:** barcode information should be easily available to the user.
